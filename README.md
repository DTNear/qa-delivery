This is a `full-stack` project created by dejwid and `modified by me`.

## Scope of this project

```bash
✨ Understanding front-end and back-end development better. Having a FE and a BE that communicate,
   helps me better to understand how an app works.
✨ As a QA, the best way to explain FE and BE testing to someone is by having a project with FE, API, and DB
   that communicate between each other.
```

## Technology Stack and Features

```bash

🚀 JavaScript for front-end and back-end
⚡ Postman for backend API
💾 MongoDB for database
🧰 Stripe for payments
🏭 CI and CD based on GitHub Actions
🚢 Deployment using Vercel

```

## Deployment

The easiest way to `deploy` my project was to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
